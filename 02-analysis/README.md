# Analysis

This phase continues the development process by realising the courses of events that we described in the requirements analysis phase. This requires the creation of sequence diagrams for each course of events. Decisions made while constructing these diagrams are also documented in the class diagram.

## Use Case Realisations (Sequence Diagrams)

Each use case contains the separate sequence diagrams for each course of events. The diagrams are stored in the `images` folder and referenced in the markdown files.

1. [Use Case 1](01-name.md)
2. [Use Case 2](02-name.md)
3. [Use Case 3](03-name.md)
4. [Use Case 4](04-name.md)
5. [Use Case 5](05-name.md)

## Class Diagram

The class diagram represents the information gained about the system by completing the use case realisations.
